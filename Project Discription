Project: Interactive Sales Data Analysis (Python)

Developed a dynamic, user-driven data analysis tool in Python where users can input monthly sales data directly via the terminal.

Leveraged Pandas for efficient data manipulation and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.

Key Highlights:

Accepts custom monthly sales data from the user (Month + Product sales).

Automatically calculates total revenue, average monthly sales, and identifies the best-performing month.

Generates line and bar charts to clearly visualize sales trends and product performance.

Demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, visualization, and user interaction programming, 
showcasing the ability to transform raw input into meaningful business insights.
